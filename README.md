  My program can predict what number between 0 to 9 has been drawn. 
  We show the program examples of the dataset in order for it to be trained. 
  After training my program, it was able to guess digits between 0 to 9 at an accuracy of 84%.
  
  I was not satisfied with this number and wanted to increase it, so my idea was to show it more examples of the dataset to the program to train it more. 
  This should increase the accuracy of the program.
